# Master's Course in Earth Observation and Geomatics

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to the courses I teach as part of the Master's program in Earth Observation and Geomatics. This repository contains educational resources, notebooks, and practical examples for both Master 1 and Master 2 OTG students.

## Repository Content

The repository is organized into three main folders, each corresponding to a specific course. Below is an overview of each course along with links to the associated resources.

### 1. Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences (Master 2 OTG-GDT/Ing√©s 3A EOST)

- **Folder:** `IA_geosciences_M2`
- **Description:** The lecture introduces key deep learning concepts, starting from the perceptron to multilayer convolutional neural networks. The practical session covers the basics of deep learning applied to aerial and satellite imagery, focusing on semantic segmentation for land cover classification. The Vaihingen dataset is used for practical exercises.
- **Content:** Lecture slides, notebooks for both lectures and practicals, examples of semantic segmentation, and methodologies for neural networks.

### 2. Programming Level 2 (Master 1 OTG)

- **Folder:** `Programmation_niv2`
- **Description:** This course focuses on satellite image processing using Python. It covers libraries such as GDAL, Numpy, OrfeoToolbox, xarray, and STAC, while introducing package management concepts using Anaconda.
- **Content:** Practical sessions on image processing, package management, and handling large datasets.

### 3. Image Processing Level 2 (Master 1 OTG)

- **Folder:** `Traitements_images_niv1`
- **Description:** Covers advanced image processing techniques using QGIS and ESA SNAP, including pixel-based and OBIA classification approaches.
- **Content:** Practical sessions using QGIS and ESA SNAP, image classification, and OBIA approaches.
